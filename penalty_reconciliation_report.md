### Situation Code Analysis
Based on analysis of scoring events and penalty data, we've identified key situation codes:
- **1451**: Power play goal (pp strength)
- **1551**: Even strength goal (ev strength)
- **Penalty situation codes**: Need further analysis from play-by-play data

### Source Reliability

- **data_completeness**: 740.00%

### Common Discrepancies
- **count_mismatch**: 12 occurrences
- **player_name_mismatch**: 2 occurrences

## Complex Penalty Rules and Scenarios

### 1. Simultaneous Penalties
- **Definition**: Multiple penalties assessed at the same time
- **Impact**: Can result in 4-on-4, 3-on-3, or other even strength scenarios
- **Reconciliation Challenge**: Must ensure all penalties are captured and power play calculations are correct
- **Example**: Game 2024021130 at 03:13 - both teams received penalties (roughing and boarding)

### 2. Team Penalties
- **Definition**: Penalties without specific player assignment (e.g., too many men on ice)
- **Impact**: Penalty served by another player, affects team statistics
- **Reconciliation Challenge**: Link penalty to serving player and validate team totals
- **Example**: "too-many-men-on-the-ice" penalty with `servedBy` field indicating who serves the penalty

### 3. Non-Power Play Penalties
- **Definition**: Penalties that don't result in power plays (fighting, misconducts)
- **Impact**: No numerical advantage, different statistical treatment
- **Reconciliation Challenge**: Ensure proper categorization and statistical handling
- **Examples**: fighting, misconduct, game-misconduct, match-penalty

### 4. Event and Situation Codes
- **Event Codes**: Identify penalty event types (PENALTY, PENALTY_SHOT)
- **Situation Codes**: Define game situations (power play, even strength, penalty kill)
- **Reconciliation Challenge**: Map codes to penalty rules and validate consistency

### 5. Penalty Type Classifications
- **MIN**: Minor penalties (2 minutes) - lead to power plays
- **MAJ**: Major penalties (5 minutes) - may or may not lead to power plays
- **BEN**: Bench penalties (team penalties) - served by designated player
- **MIS**: Misconduct penalties (10 minutes) - no power play
- **MAT**: Match penalties - ejection from game

## Enhanced Reconciliation Strategy for 100% Accuracy

### 1. Primary Data Source
- **Gamecenter Landing** remains the authoritative source for penalty data
- **Enhanced Validation**: Cross-reference with event codes and situation codes
- **Complex Scenario Handling**: Implement logic for simultaneous penalties and team penalties

### 2. Advanced Cross-Validation
- **Power Play Validation**: Verify power play calculations based on penalty types
- **Simultaneous Penalty Logic**: Ensure 4-on-4 and other scenarios are correctly calculated
- **Team Penalty Assignment**: Link team penalties to serving players

### 3. Event Code Analysis
- **Penalty Event Types**: Map PENALTY vs PENALTY_SHOT events
- **Situation Code Mapping**: Understand power play vs even strength scenarios
- **Rule Validation**: Implement NHL penalty rules for validation

### 4. Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Implement complex penalty scenario handling
2. **Medium Priority**: Develop event code and situation code analysis
3. **Low Priority**: Enhance HTML parsing for additional context

## Detailed Findings and Examples

### Game 2024021130 Analysis
**Simultaneous Penalties at 03:13:**
- PHI: N. Seeler - roughing-removing-opponents-helmet (2 min)
- TOR: C. Jarnkrok - boarding (2 min)
- **Result**: 4-on-4 even strength play (no power play)

**Team Penalty at 13:57:**
- PHI: too-many-men-on-the-ice (2 min bench penalty)
- **Served by**: M. Michkov
- **Impact**: Power play for TOR

**Power Play Goal Analysis:**
- Situation Code: 1451
- Strength: "pp" (power play)
- **Validation**: Goal scored during power play from team penalty

### Key Reconciliation Rules Identified

1. **Simultaneous Penalties Rule**: When both teams receive penalties at the same time, the result is even strength (4-on-4) not a power play
2. **Team Penalty Rule**: Bench penalties must be linked to the serving player for accurate PIM tracking
3. **Power Play Calculation Rule**: Only minor penalties result in power plays; majors, misconducts, and fighting do not
4. **Situation Code Rule**: 1451 = power play, 1551 = even strength
