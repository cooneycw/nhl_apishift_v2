# Boxscore Implementation Plan
## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for processing and curating the NHL boxscore data based on the comprehensive analysis of the JSON files. The plan focuses on extracting, validating, and organizing the rich statistical data contained in the boxscore files.

## Key Findings from Analysis

### Data Richness
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 100+ boxscore files for the 2024-25 season
- **Multi-Level Statistics**: Team, player, and position-specific data
- **Final Game Data**: All files represent completed games with verified results
- **Quality Structure**: Well-organized JSON with consistent formatting
- **High Reliability**: Final statistics, no live game data concerns

### Statistical Categories Identified
1. **Team Statistics**: Final scores, shots on goal, game context
2. **Player Statistics**: Goals, assists, points, time on ice, shifts, plus/minus
3. **Position-Specific**: Faceoffs (centers), saves (goalies), defensive play
4. **Final Game Data**: Completed game results, final period information, verified statistics

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data Extraction and Parsing (Week 1)

#### 1.1 JSON Parser Development
```python
# Core parsing structure
class BoxscoreParser:
    def parse_game_metadata(self, data):
        # Extract game ID, date, final state, period info
        
    def parse_team_statistics(self, data):
        # Extract final team scores, SOG, context
        
    def parse_player_statistics(self, data):
        # Extract final player stats by position
        
    def parse_goalie_statistics(self, data):
        # Extract final goalie-specific stats
```

#### 1.2 Data Structure Definition
```python
# Core data models
class GameMetadata:
    game_id: int
    season: int
    game_date: str
    game_state: str  # Always "OFF" for completed games
    period_info: dict  # Final period information
    
class TeamStatistics:
    team_id: int
    team_abbrev: str
    score: int
    shots_on_goal: int
    home_away: str
    
class PlayerStatistics:
    player_id: int
    position: str
    goals: int
    assists: int
    points: int
    time_on_ice: str
    shifts: int
    plus_minus: int
```

#### 1.3 File Processing Pipeline
- **Batch Processing**: Process all boxscore files in parallel
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for malformed JSON
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor processing completion
- **Data Validation**: Basic format and range validation

### Phase 2: Data Validation and Quality Assurance (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Cross-Reference Validation
```python
# Validation checks
def validate_team_consistency(boxscore_data, teams_data):
    # Verify team IDs match teams.json
    
def validate_game_consistency(boxscore_data, games_data):
    # Verify game IDs match games.json and game state is "OFF"
    
def validate_player_consistency(boxscore_data):
    # Verify player IDs are consistent across games
    
def validate_final_game_state(boxscore_data):
    # Verify all games are completed (gameState = "OFF")
```

#### 2.2 Statistical Validation
```python
# Business logic validation
def validate_points_calculation(player_stats):
    # Goals + Assists = Points
    
def validate_time_on_ice(player_stats):
    # TOI format and reasonable ranges
    
def validate_position_specific_stats(player_stats):
    # Faceoffs for centers, saves for goalies
```

#### 2.3 Quality Metrics
- **Completeness**: % of required fields present
- **Consistency**: % of logical relationships maintained
- **Accuracy**: % of values within expected ranges
- **Finality**: % of games with confirmed final state ("OFF")

### Phase 3: Data Transformation and Storage (Week 3)

#### 3.1 Data Normalization
```python
# Transform raw data to analysis-ready format
def normalize_time_on_ice(time_str):
    # Convert "14:07" to seconds (847)
    
def normalize_percentages(percentage):
    # Convert decimal to percentage (0.5 -> 50.0)
    
def categorize_positions(position):
    # Group positions (C/L/R -> Forward, D -> Defense, G -> Goalie)
```

#### 3.2 Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Core tables
CREATE TABLE games (
    game_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    season INTEGER,
    game_date DATE,
    game_state VARCHAR(10),
    period_type VARCHAR(10),
    home_team_id INTEGER,
    away_team_id INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE team_game_stats (
    game_id INTEGER,
    team_id INTEGER,
    score INTEGER,
    shots_on_goal INTEGER,
    home_away VARCHAR(4)
);

CREATE TABLE player_game_stats (
    game_id INTEGER,
    player_id INTEGER,
    position VARCHAR(1),
    goals INTEGER,
    assists INTEGER,
    points INTEGER,
    time_on_ice_seconds INTEGER,
    shifts INTEGER,
    plus_minus INTEGER
);
```

#### 3.3 CSV Export Structure
```
curated/
├── games/
│   ├── game_metadata.csv
│   ├── team_game_stats.csv
│   └── player_game_stats.csv
├── players/
│   ├── player_performance.csv
│   └── player_time_analysis.csv
└── teams/
    ├── team_performance.csv
    └── team_game_results.csv
```

### Phase 4: Advanced Analytics and Insights (Week 4)

#### 4.1 Derived Statistics
```python
# Calculate advanced metrics
def calculate_per_60_stats(player_stats, time_on_ice):
    # Points per 60 minutes, goals per 60 minutes
    
def calculate_efficiency_ratios(player_stats):
    # Shooting percentage, faceoff efficiency
    
def calculate_team_totals(game_stats):
    # Aggregate player stats to team totals
```

#### 4.2 Position-Specific Analysis
```python
# Position-based analytics
def analyze_forward_performance(player_stats):
    # Offensive production, time management
    
def analyze_defenseman_performance(player_stats):
    # Defensive metrics, ice time patterns
    
def analyze_goalie_performance(goalie_stats):
    # Save percentages, situational performance
```

#### 4.3 Temporal Analysis
```python
# Time-based insights
def analyze_shift_patterns(player_stats):
    # Shift frequency, rest patterns
    
def analyze_ice_time_distribution(player_stats):
    # TOI distribution by position, game situation
```
