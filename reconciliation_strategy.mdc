# NHL Data Reconciliation Strategy
## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for reconciling data across multiple sources in the NHL dataset. Reconciliation ensures data consistency, identifies discrepancies, and establishes reliable relationships between different data files and statistics.

## Data Source Relationships

### Primary Data Flow
```
JSON Sources (Clean) → HTML Reports (Validation) → CSV Outputs (Curated)
     ↓                        ↓                        ↓
teams.json              Game Summaries           Curated Datasets
games.json              Event Summaries          Quality Reports
boxscores/              Play-by-Play             Reconciliation Logs
playbyplay/             Time on Ice
```

### Cross-Source Dependencies
- **teams.json** ↔ **games.json**: Team identifiers and metadata
- **games.json** ↔ **boxscores/**: Game results and statistics
- **boxscores/** ↔ **playbyplay/**: Event-level validation
- **HTML Reports** ↔ **JSON Data**: Cross-validation and enrichment

## Reconciliation Objectives

### 1. Data Consistency
- **Identifier Resolution**: Ensure consistent team and player IDs across sources
- **Value Alignment**: Verify statistical values match between sources
- **Format Standardization**: Normalize data formats and units

### 2. Quality Assurance
- **Completeness Validation**: Ensure all expected data is present
- **Accuracy Verification**: Cross-check critical statistics
- **Logical Consistency**: Validate business rules and relationships

### 3. Relationship Mapping
- **Entity Relationships**: Establish clear links between entities
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Organize data by season → team → game → player → event
- **Temporal Relationships**: Link events across time periods

## Reconciliation Workflow

### Phase 1: Source Assessment
1. **Data Inventory**
   - Catalog all available data sources
   - Document data structures and schemas
   - Identify key identifiers and relationships

2. **Quality Baseline**
   - Assess data completeness by source
   - Identify known data quality issues
   - Establish quality metrics and thresholds

3. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Map entity relationships across sources
   - Identify foreign key relationships
   - Document data dependencies

### Phase 2: Identifier Resolution
1. **Team Identifier Reconciliation**
   - **Source**: teams.json, games.json, boxscores, HTML reports
   - **Challenge**: Different ID formats (numeric vs. abbreviation)
   - **Solution**: Create comprehensive team lookup table
   - **Validation**: Cross-reference team names and abbreviations

2. **Player Identifier Reconciliation**
   - **Source**: boxscores, playbyplay, HTML reports
   - **Challenge**: Player name variations and ID consistency
   - **Solution**: Establish player master record
   - **Validation**: Cross-reference player names and statistics

3. **Game Identifier Reconciliation**
   - **Source**: games.json, boxscores, HTML reports
   - **Challenge**: Game ID formats and season associations
   - **Solution**: Standardize game ID format
   - **Validation**: Verify game metadata consistency

### Phase 3: Statistical Validation
1. **Core Statistics Cross-Validation**
   - **Goals**: Compare between games.json, boxscores, and HTML reports
   - **Shots**: Validate SOG between boxscores and game summaries
   - **Penalties**: Cross-check PIM between sources
   - **Time on Ice**: Verify between boxscores and time-on-ice reports

2. **Derived Statistics Validation**
   - **Team Totals**: Sum individual player stats vs. team totals
   - **Game Totals**: Aggregate event data vs. game summaries
   - **Season Totals**: Sum game data vs. season statistics

3. **Logical Consistency Checks**
   - **Score Validation**: Home + Away goals = Total goals
   - **Time Validation**: Period times sum to total game time
   - **Player Validation**: Players listed in roster appear in statistics

### Phase 4: Discrepancy Resolution
1. **Discrepancy Identification**
   - **Automated Checks**: Programmatic comparison of values
   - **Manual Review**: Human verification of critical statistics
   - **Pattern Analysis**: Identify systematic data quality issues

2. **Resolution Strategies**
   - **Source Priority**: Establish hierarchy of data source reliability
   - **Correction Methods**: Document how to handle discrepancies
   - **Quality Flags**: Mark data with confidence indicators

3. **Documentation and Tracking**
   - **Reconciliation Logs**: Record all discrepancies and resolutions
   - **Quality Reports**: Generate summary of data quality
   - **Update Procedures**: Document ongoing reconciliation processes

## Key Reconciliation Points

### Game-Level Reconciliation
```
games.json (Schedule) ↔ boxscores/ (Results) ↔ HTML Reports (Details)
     ↓                        ↓                        ↓
Game Metadata           Game Statistics         Game Summary
Team Information        Player Performance      Event Details
Venue/Time Data         Final Score            Time on Ice
Game State              Period Information     Shift Data
```

**Validation Rules:**
- Game IDs must match across all sources
- Final scores must be consistent
- Team identifiers must resolve correctly
- Game dates and times must align
- Period information must be consistent (regular vs. overtime)
- Game state must be "OFF" (completed games only)

### Player-Level Reconciliation
```
boxscores/ (Game Stats) ↔ playbyplay/ (Events) ↔ HTML Reports (Details)
     ↓                        ↓                        ↓
Player Performance       Player Events           Player Summary
Game Statistics          Shift Data             Time on Ice
Season Totals            Event Details          Advanced Stats
```

**Validation Rules:**
- Player IDs must be consistent across sources
- Game statistics must sum to season totals
- Time on ice must be logically consistent (MM:SS format)
- Performance metrics must align with events
- Position-specific stats must be appropriate (faceoffs for centers, saves for goalies)
