"""
Player and Team-Level Goal Data Reconciliation System

This system performs detailed reconciliation of goal data at the player and team level,
comparing HTML reports against the authoritative Play-by-Play JSON source.

Key Features:
- Player-level goal reconciliation (scorer, assists)
- Team-level goal reconciliation (total goals, goal distribution)
- Detailed discrepancy analysis with specific player/team information
- Comprehensive reporting for data quality assurance

Usage:
    python player_team_goal_reconciliation.py --game-id 2024020001
    python player_team_goal_reconciliation.py --all-games
    python player_team_goal_reconciliation.py --team-analysis
