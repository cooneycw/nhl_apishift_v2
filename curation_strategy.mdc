# NHL Data Curation Strategy
## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for curating NHL data collected from the API. The curation process transforms raw data into clean, consistent, and analysis-ready datasets while maintaining data integrity and traceability.

## Data Sources Overview

### Primary Data Sources (Cleanest to Process)
1. **JSON Files** - Most structured and reliable
   - `teams.json` - Team metadata and information
   - `games.json` - Game schedule and basic information
   - `boxscores/` - Detailed game statistics and player performance
   - `playbyplay/` - Event-level game data

2. **HTML Reports** - Semi-structured, require parsing
   - `GS/` - Game Summaries
   - `ES/` - Event Summaries  
   - `PL/` - Play-by-Play
   - `FC/` - Faceoff Comparison
   - `FS/` - Faceoff Summary
   - `RO/` - Rosters
   - `SC/` - Shot Summary
   - `SS/` - Shot Summary (alternative)
   - `TH/` - Time on Ice Home
   - `TV/` - Time on Ice Visitor

3. **CSV Files** - Already processed data
   - Various curated datasets in the csv directory

## Curation Objectives

### 1. Data Quality Assurance
- **Completeness**: Ensure all expected data fields are present
- **Consistency**: Standardize formats, units, and naming conventions

### 2. Data Integration
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure consistency between JSON and HTML sources
- **Relationship Mapping**: Establish clear relationships between entities
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Organize data by season → team → game → player → event

### 3. Data Enrichment
- **Derived Statistics**: Calculate advanced metrics and ratios
- **Contextual Information**: Add metadata and annotations
- **Historical Context**: Link to previous seasons and trends

## Curation Workflow

   - Establish quality metrics

### Phase 2: Data Standardization
1. **Format Standardization**
   - Convert all data to consistent formats
   - Standardize date/time formats
   - Normalize team and player identifiers

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - Establish consistent field naming
   - Standardize team abbreviations
   - Normalize player names

3. **Data Type Enforcement**
   - Ensure proper data types for all fields
   - Handle missing values consistently
   - Validate data ranges and constraints

### Phase 3: Data Integration
1. **Entity Resolution**
   - Link players across different data sources
   - Resolve team identifier inconsistencies
   - Establish game-to-event relationships

2. **Cross-Validation**
   - Compare statistics between JSON and HTML sources
   - Identify and resolve discrepancies
   - Document reconciliation strategies

3. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Establish foreign key relationships
   - Create lookup tables for common entities
   - Build hierarchical data structures

### Phase 4: Data Enrichment
1. **Derived Metrics**
   - Calculate advanced statistics

### Phase 5: Penalty Data Curation
1. **Primary Source Processing**
   - Extract penalty data from Gamecenter Landing JSON files
   - Validate penalty structure and completeness
   - Standardize penalty type classifications

2. **Cross-Source Validation**
   - Validate penalty counts against Boxscore PIM data
   - Cross-reference with HTML Play-by-Play reports
   - Implement automated discrepancy detection

3. **Penalty Data Standardization**
   - Normalize player names across all sources
   - Standardize penalty descriptions and codes
   - Create consistent penalty timing formats
   - Generate performance indicators
   - Create composite scores

2. **Contextual Data**
   - Add season and game context
   - Include venue and schedule information
   - Link to external reference data

3. **Quality Indicators**
   - Add data quality flags
   - Include confidence scores
   - Document data lineage

## Data Quality Standards

### Completeness Requirements
- **Required Fields**: All primary identifiers must be present
- **Optional Fields**: Document missing data patterns
- **Coverage**: Ensure minimum data coverage thresholds

### Accuracy Standards
- **Validation Rules**: Implement business logic validation
- **Cross-Checking**: Verify data consistency across sources
- **Error Handling**: Document and handle data anomalies

### Consistency Standards
- **Format Consistency**: Uniform data formats across all sources
- **Naming Consistency**: Standardized naming conventions
- **Value Consistency**: Consistent value representations
